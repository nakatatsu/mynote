# Development Constitution

AI and developers adhere to this document for all activities related to coding, design, infrastructure, and operations.

## Core Principles

### I. Security as the Foundation

Security be built-in, not added later. Security reviews take place before every release, and all findings from security scanning tools be resolve or allow.

### II. Code Quality

Every line of code meet production-grade standards. Code quality is measured using linters, static analysis tools, formatters, and other appropriate methods. All code must comply with specifications.

### III. Design and Code, UI Standardization

All work be standardized wherever possible. AI, developers and users should be able to perform the same tasks in the same way. Designs and code serving similar purposes should follow consistent patterns and structures.

### IV. Test Automation

While strict test-first development is not mandatory, but automated tests always be implemented. Overall test coverage reach at least 80%, with 100% coverage required for critical paths.

### V. Performance by Design

Performance requirements should be defined upfront and continuously validated. However, optimizations remain balanced—avoid premature or excessive optimization unless justified by clear performance needs.

### VI. Observability and Monitoring

All system components should be as observable as possible.

### VII. Cost Optimization

Optimize both development and operational costs as long as essential requirements are not compromised. Unnecessary should expenses be avoided.
