# CLAUDE.md

This repository focuses on the development system for AI-driven development. It contains development documents and sample code.

## Important

* Check the `CLAUDE.md` file in each working directory.
* Feel free to use `[Repository Root]/.tmp/*` for experiments, testing, and any temporary work.
* Use `/commit-commands:commit-push-pr` to commit changes and create pull requests.
* Use `/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr` to review pull requests.
* Ask `claude-code-guide` to create SKILLS, sub-agents, and research Claude Code features.
* Never work directly on the `main` branch. Of course, never commit to `main`.
* Never skip any steps in the user’s instructions.
* Always follow issue-driven development. Document your work in a GitHub issue for each task. If no issue exists, create one. Add issue number when creating PRs.
